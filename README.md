# FactsHub 

FactsHub is a community-powered platform for discovering and sharing verified facts. 

Traditional social media is driven by impressions and engagement. It allows any type of information to spread virtually unchecked and regardless of accuracy, as long as it can generate attention. 

FactsHub is built to prioritize **truth over traffic**. It ensures that only well-vetted informations and reports gains visibility. 

This makes FactsHub a repository of high-quality information (news, issues, etc.) where people could share important and unbiased information that they feel the community would benefit from. 

Besides from the community within it, this also gives everyone a place on the internet for them to discover only well-vetted information. 

## How it works 

FactsHub allows users to share any type of information. Those information will be verified by the community. [If the community flags it, it will be diminished.]

FactsHub algorithm prioritize posts vetted by users who have gained good reputation. Users reputation will depend on if their own posts gets vetted and received well by the community and if the reviews they've done on other users' posts aligns well with that of the concensus.
